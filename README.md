# Disappearing-Text-Writing-App
Portfolio
    • This project could be described as simple as you will only need two pages, one as a welcome page and the other is where you would place the text area input field and it will need to automatically make the form post by a given time. The python program will evaluate the equality of the field with previously stored data, when they are equal it means, the user had stopped typing and it will clear the field, else it will render the current data entered in the field and allow the user to continue typing.
    • The hardest part was implementing the auto submit function to post the form that could only be done by the use of JavaScript. While the easy part was to compare the data.
    • The big learning from today was as a front-end developer you need to learn and master JavaScript, there are tools like bootstrap can simplify the job but some function can only ne conducted by JavaScript.
